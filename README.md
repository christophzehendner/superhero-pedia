This is a file where I explain how I coded the #superhero-pedia:

1. First of all I made a quick brainstorming about the design. One hour later I drew a basic design on my iPad. After that I was thinking about additional features. I was asking myself what kind of features I would like to use. Then I was sure that I would like to implement a Favorite rubric. The ability to save your superheros is a very nice feature for me.

2. After that I started coding. First of all I created the html code for the index landing page. Then the CSS design part and finally the JS file. I had some troubles connecting the API, but with some YouTube tutorials I finally made it. I repeated this procedure three times with the favorite and details documentsâ€¦

3. This project took me sooo many hours and I am really proud of the final result. The most difficult part for me was the API connecting and JS.
